# Conjunction fallacy

When comparing the probability of two events occurring together (both being true) versus the probability of
a single event occurring (one being true), it is generally less probable for the two events to be true simultaneously.
This principle is known as the conjunction fallacy, which is a cognitive bias that leads people to overestimate
the probability of specific combinations of events compared to the probability of each individual event.

To understand why the conjunction fallacy occurs, consider the following example:

```
Event A: "John is a doctor."
Event B: "John is a doctor and plays the piano."
```

The conjunction fallacy arises when people perceive Event B as more likely to be true than Event A alone.
This misconception occurs because the additional condition of playing the piano makes the statement more detailed and
seemingly more specific, which can lead to a perception of increased likelihood. However, statistically speaking,
the probability of both conditions being true is inherently lower than the probability of either condition alone.

In general, the likelihood of two events occurring together is influenced by the individual probabilities of each event.
When events are independent, meaning that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event,
the probability of both events happening is calculated by multiplying their individual probabilities. Therefore,
the joint probability is lower than the individual probabilities unless there is a dependency between the events.

It is important to note that the conjunction fallacy is a cognitive bias that can lead to errors in decision-making and judgment.
To make accurate assessments of probabilities, it is crucial to consider the individual probabilities of
events and the potential dependencies between them.
